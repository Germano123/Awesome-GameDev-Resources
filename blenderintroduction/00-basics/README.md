# Blender basics

This course was designed to give you a solid foundation on modeling and to be the introduction to Blender 3D. It is important to note that, for effective learning, it is recommended that you commit to at least 2 hours of daily practice, for a minimum period of 11 days, each day per chapter, after reading the material. This methodology will allow you to assimilate and apply the concepts presented, improving your skills and expanding your knowledge in the area of ​​3D modeling.

Throughout the course, you will become familiar with the Blender interface and learn fundamental modeling techniques, the basis of rendering and shaders, modeling unwraps and texturing, concepts of rigging and animation, hard surface modeling and organic modeling and at last bbut not least digital sculpting.

You'll learn to create objects from basic shapes and use extrusion, subdivision, and modeling tools and techniques to shape your models. We'll explore both hard surface object modeling and organic modeling, allowing you to create a variety of shapes and characters.

As we move forward, we'll cover rendering, which involves creating final images. And with that, you'll learn how to configure lighting, apply materials and shaders to objects, as well as explore texturing techniques to add realistic detail to your models, as well as other techniques that can be applied to other styles.

In addition, we'll explore rigging, which involves creating bone structures to give the models movement. And then you'll learn how to create a skeleton, define weights to influence the model's deformation, modeling techniques so that your model doesn't suffer strange deformations, and animating basic movements.

Finally, we'll dive into digital sculpting, a powerful method for creating detailed, organic models. You'll learn to sculpt and shape your models directly on the surface, adding subtle details and more intricate textures.

By mastering these topics, you will be prepared to create amazing 3D models and explore the full creative potential of Blender. Ready to dive into this exciting 3D modeling journey? Let's start!
