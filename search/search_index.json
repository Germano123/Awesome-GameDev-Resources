C++ is one of the closest intelligible programming languages before reaching the level of  machine code, as known as Assembly Language. If you code in machine code, you obviously will code precisely what  you want the machine to do, but this task is too painful to be the de-facto standard of coding. So we need  something more straightforward and more human-readable. So C++ lies in this exact area of being close to assembly language and still able to be \"easily\" understandable. Note the quotes, they are there because it might not be that easy when you compare its syntax to other languages, C++ has to obey some constraints to keep the generated binary fast  as a mad horse while trying to be easier than assembly.

So, if you are a lazy  mobile developer and do not want to learn how to do code efficiently, you will make your app drain more energy  from the battery just by making the user wait for the task to be finished or by doing lots of unnecessary  calculations! You will be the reason the user has not enough power to use their phones up to the end of the day.  In fact, you will be punishing your user by using your app. You don\u2019t want that, right?

Hey ruby, don\u2019t be shy, I know you look  gorgeous, and I  admire you a lot, but can you dress up faster and be ready to run anytime soon? </p> <p>You don\u2019t need makeup to run fast. That\u2019s the idea. If the language does lots of fancy stuff, it won\u2019t be extracting the juicy power of the CPU.</p> <p>So let\u2019s first clarify some concepts for a fair comparison. Some languages do not generate binaries that run in your  CPU. Some of them run on top of a virtual machine. The Virtual Machine(VM) is a piece of software that, in runtime,  translates the bytecode or even compiles source code to something the CPU can understand. It\u2019s like an old car;  some of them will make you wait for the ignition or even get warm enough to run fast. I am looking at you Java and JavaScript. It is a funny concept, I admit, but you can see here that the ones that run on top of a translation device  would never run as fast as a compiled binary ready to run on the CPU.</p> <p>So let\u2019s bring some ideas from my own experience, and I invite you to test by yourself. Just search for \"programming  languages benchmark\" on your preferred search engine or go here. </p> <p></p> <p>I don\u2019t want to start a flame-war. Those numbers might be wrong, but the overall idea is correct. Assuming C++ does not  add much overhead to your native binary, let\u2019s set the speed to run as 1x. Java would be around 1.4x slower, and  JavaScript is 1.6x, python 40x, and ruby 100x. The only good competitor in the house is Rust because its compiled code  runs straight on the CPU efficiently with lots of quality-of-life additions. Rust gives almost similar results if  you do not play around with memory-intensive problems. Another honorable mention is WASM - Web Assembly, although it is  a bytecode for a virtual machine, many programming languages are able to target it(compile for it), it is becoming blazing fast and it is getting traction nowadays, keep tuned. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"intro/01-introduction/#who-should-learn-c","title":"Who should learn C++","text":"<p>YOU!

So, given its nature of being near assembly, with C++, you will control precisely what instructions the CPU will  run.</p> <p>But, there is a catch here: for each CPU, you will need a compiler for that instruction set. Ex.: the compiler GCC can generate an executable program for ARM processors, and the generated program won\u2019t work on x86 processors; In the same  way, an x64 executable won\u2019t work on an x86; you need to match the binary instructions generated by the compiler with  the same instruction set available on the target CPU you want to run it.

The machine code is a sequence of instructions that are specific to a  particular computer architecture and operating system. The source code is written in a high-level programming  language, such as C++, Java, or Python, which is easier for humans to read and write. The compiler converts the  source code into machine code that can be run on a computer. There are different types of compilers, including  cross-compilers, which can compile code for one type of computer to run on another type of computer, and  just-in-time (JIT) compilers, which compile code at runtime. Compilers are an important part of the software  development process, as they allow developers to write code in a high-level language that is then translated into  machine code that can be run on a specific platform.</p> <p>This where things get tricky, C++ compiles the code into a binary that runs directly on the processor and interacts  with the operating system. So we can have multiple combinations here. Most compilers are cross-platform, but there  is exceptions.

Anonymous functions are often referred to as lambda functions or just lambdas. They are useful for situations where you only need to use a function in one place, or when you don't want to give a name to a function for some other reason. </p> <pre><code>auto lambda = [](int x, int y) { return x + y; };\n// auto lambda = [] (int x, int y) -&gt; int { return x + y; }; // or you can specify the return type\nint z = lambda(1, 2);  // z is now 3\n</code></pre> <p>In this case the only variables accessible by the lambda function scope are the ones passed as parameter <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and works just like a normal function, but it can be declared inside at any scope.</p> <p>If you want to make a variable available to the lambda, you can pass it via captures, and it can be by-value or by-reference. To capture a variable by value, just pass the variable name inside the <code>[]</code>. To capture a variable by reference, you use the <code>&amp;</code> operator followed by the variable name inside the <code>[]</code>. Here is an example of capturing a variable by value:</p> <pre><code>int x = 1;\nauto lambda = [x] { return x + 1; };\n</code></pre> <p>The value of <code>x</code> is copied into the lambda function, and any changes to <code>x</code> inside the lambda function have no effect on the original variable.</p> <p>Here is an example of capturing a variable by reference:</p> <pre><code>int x = 1;\nauto lambda = [&amp;x] { return x + 1; };\n</code></pre> <p>The lambda function has direct access to the original variable, and any changes to <code>x</code> inside the lambda function are reflected in the original variable.</p> <p>You can also capture multiple variables by separating them with a comma. For example:</p> <pre><code>int x = 1, y = 2;\nauto lambda = [x, &amp;y] { x += 1; y += 1; return x + y; };\n</code></pre> <p>This defines a lambda function that captures <code>x</code> by-value and <code>y</code> by-reference. The lambda function can modify <code>y</code> but not <code>x</code>.</p> <p>Lambda captures are a useful feature of C++ that allow you to write more concise and expressive code. They can be especially useful when working with algorithms from the Standard Template Library (STL), where you often need to pass a function as an argument.</p> <p>In order to capture everything automatically you can either capture by copy <code>[=]</code> or by reference <code>[&amp;]</code>.</p> <pre><code>// capture everything via copy\nint x = 1, y = 2;\nauto lambda = [=] { // x += 1; // cannot be changed because it is read-only \n// y += 1; // cannot be changed because it is read-only\nreturn x + y; };\nint c = lambda(); // c will be 5, but x and y wont change their values\n</code></pre> <pre><code>// capture everything via reference\nint x = 1, y = 2;\nauto lambda = [&amp;] { x += 1; y += 1; return x + y; };\nint c = lambda(); // c will be 5, x will be 2, and y will be 3.\n</code></pre> <p>For a more in depth understanding, go to Manual Reference or check this tutorial. </p>"},{"location":"intro/06-functions/#homework","title":"Homework","text":"<ul> <li>Do all exercises up to this topic here.</li> <li>Hexadecimal converter.

Visit it.</p> <p>You are a complex being and hard to define. I know. It is hard to put yourself in a frame or box, but this process is  relevant to make the life of the others to evaluate if they want more you or not. If for some reason a person is  reading your portfolio, it means that you are ahead of the others, so you must respect their time and goals while  they are reading your content.</p> <p>What you do, do not define what you are, you can even work with something you dont love as long it is part of a bigger  plan. Given that, you have to know how to differentiate yourself from your work while respecting your  feelings. The sweet spot is when you mix who you are with what you do, and you have nice feelings about it. But this  can be hard to achieve and require maturity to mix things. If you dont have a clear understand of those aspects of  yourself, you will be subjected to be exploited by bad companies and managers.</p> <p>It is totally fine try to excel some job you are not passionate. You just have to find means to make your time  doing it as enjoyable as possible. In the end of the journey it will slowly become something you can be proud of,  and you will become a different person than the one you are now. Understanding this kind of mentality will help you  endure more and be more resilient to problems. </p> <p>Keep track of your progress towards your goal. First of all, have a clear goal, so you can build a path to it.  Otherwise, any path would sound just like any other apathetic path. Having a clear goal will make your path  shine and easy to choose. It will help you in difficult moments where you feel uncomfortable by being just a small  piece of a machinery. You will be able to act as part of machine while you need to achieve your goal as a necessary  step.</p> <p>Focus on always keep track on your evolution on your journey to excellence. Don't compare too much yourself to the  others, everyone is facing a different journey and everyone took different paths in their career that probably you  didn't have the option to chose in the past. But you cannot be uncritical either, you have to analyse your progress and  check if your current path is making you life good, you have to take a decision to change the plan or even the goal  with the new information you learned through the current path you are pursuing.</p> <p>In other point of view, you wont start your career as senior developer, so you have to build your own path. Making  mistakes is part of the process, and that is the reason you will be gradually exposed to big things. You should  accept yourself, don't push too hard, and do some basic stuff.

This example showcases that you were part of something huge, and it is easily understandable.     - There is a high correlation on high performant people that they usually shine in side-projects or even hobbies. So they look for it. Ex.: Google encourages employees to devote 20% of their time to hobbies or skill-building. - Competence     - They need to evaluate if you are really able to solve the problem properly, in a meaningful time, and in a team. You have to describe which tools, tech stack and how you glue everything in order to solve the problem. Be assured you are correctly expressing yourself here, because it is one of the central part that is not taken superficially. - Innovation and Curiosity     - Innovative developers solve problems out of the box. It doesn't matter how complex the problem is, but if you solve in a innovative way, reframe it or do any magic to solve it, chances are to have good points here;     - Good companies incentives research and test new stuff. So they usually like to see your deliverables with new bleeding-edge technology tools. - Protectiveness     - Usually the more proactive developers tend to have more leadership positions.

Express problems that arise and how do you manage that before it become a real problem.  - Learner     - It is good to be always tuned with the current evolution of the technology, so try to keep the education section always updated with some courses or publish blog posts about some new tech.  - Thoughtfulness - Risk management  - Thinking big</p>"},{"location":"portfolio/04-communication/#homework","title":"Homework","text":"<ul> <li>Write the content for each one of your projects and all other sections of your portfolio.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"portfolio/05-style/","title":"Portfolio styling","text":""},{"location":"portfolio/05-style/#accessibility","title":"Accessibility","text":""},{"location":"portfolio/05-style/#non-blocking-content","title":"Non-blocking content","text":""},{"location":"portfolio/05-style/#dos-and-donts","title":"DOs and DON'Ts","text":""},{"location":"portfolio/06-strategy/","title":"Strategies to get hired","text":"<ul> <li>Portfolio</li> <li>Interviews</li> <li>Social Network</li> </ul>"},{"location":"portfolio/06-strategy/#strategies-for-your-portfolio","title":"Strategies for your portfolio","text":""},{"location":"portfolio/06-strategy/#analytics","title":"Analytics","text":"<ul> <li>Analytics.
